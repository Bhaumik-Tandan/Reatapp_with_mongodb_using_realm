# COLLEGE DASHBOARD USING ReactJS

This is the sample project of how can we dirrectly connect
ReactJs with MongoDB database without the use of any kind of 
backend.


## Demo

When we open the site we come accross a loading screen like this

After the site has been loaded and data has been fetched by default it render us to the college tab in the page
where we can see the list of all the collges in an interactive table table

We can switch through all the the three tabs by clicking on them.
In the visulisation an animation also has been added in the pie charts

We can drill down to any field by clicking on any segment in the pie chart
and all the rows of that segment will be displayed, as you can see that when we search for
city 9 so the number of pages did not get reduced in the bottom right because all the collges
displayed are from that city only whereas when we seached for btech so the number of pages got reduced.
We can also export the data in form of pdf or csv.
